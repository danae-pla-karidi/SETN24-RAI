            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Research in AI promises to bring huge advances in all aspects of human life from groundbreaking discoveries in medicine and self-driving cars to the arts. But it also raises serious ethical concerns. The RAI workshop will focus on the foundations, principles, and practices of developing and deploying AI systems responsibly, addressing issues of fair and unbiased use, transparency, explainability, respect for human autonomy, privacy,  accountability, safety and trustworthiness. Besides covering technical aspects, the workshop will also provide a broader interdisciplinary perspective by including addressing legal, social and ethical perspectives  aiming to provide participants with a well-rounded understanding of the implications and considerations surrounding AI beyond just its technical implementation.</p>
